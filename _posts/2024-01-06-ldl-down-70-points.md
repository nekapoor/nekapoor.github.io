## Some Context

* 39-year-old South Asian male  
* Starting weight ≈ 160 lb (72 kg)  
* Target daily intake ≈ 1,700 kcal (per TDEE calculator)

---

## Introduction

On **28 Sep 2023** my lipid panel showed:

* **Total cholesterol:** 258 mg/dL  
* **LDL-C:** 175 mg/dL

That Sunday my doctor phoned to recommend starting a statin **immediately**.  
I asked for three months to try dietary changes first—right through the holidays.

Three months later (**5 Jan 2024**) the repeat panel read:

| Marker           | 28 Sep 2023 | 5 Jan 2024 | Change |
|------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Total Cholesterol| 258         | **178**    | −80 |
| LDL-C            | 175         | **105**    | −70 |

## TL;DR — What Actually Worked

1. **Fiber ↑** — ≈ 40 g /day (half soluble, half insoluble)  
2. **Saturated fat ↓**  
3. Protein kept ≥ 100 g /day to maintain satiety and lean mass  

I had previously obsessed over protein and ignored fiber; this flip made the difference.

## Foods I Ate *Almost Every Day*

| Item | Typical Portion | Notes / macros |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **1 % milk chai latte** | 8 oz 1 % milk + 1.5 Tbsp loose chai + 8 crushed cardamom pods | *P*: 9 g, *C*: 15 g, *F*: 2.5 g, SatFat 1.5 g |
| **Black coffee** | 10 oz pourover | zero-cal pick-me-up |
| **Protein + fiber smoothie** | see ingredients below | *P*: 45 g, *F*: 11 g, Fiber ≈ 22 g |
| **Greek yogurt + blueberries** | 1 cup yogurt + 100 g berries | *P*: 22 g, Fiber 2 g |
| **Apple and/or pear** | 1 medium | Fiber ≈ 5 g |
| **Stovetop popcorn** | ¼ cup kernels | Fiber 10 g, *P*: 8 g |
| **Eggs** | 2 large | SatFat 3 g |

### Smoothie ingredients

* 8 oz unsweetened soy milk  
* 30 g Gold Standard whey  
* 12 g chia seeds (soaked)  
* 8 g psyllium husk  
* 16 g peanut-butter powder  
* 5 g cinnamon  
* 5 g unsweetened cocoa

### Why psyllium?

Psyllium husk is mostly **soluble** fiber, which forms a gel in the gut and
helps pull LDL out of circulation.

## Typical Dinners

* Indian yellow curry  
* Wild salmon + rice + edamame  
* Pan-fried scallops  
* Indian **daal** (often with extra yogurt)  
* Cottage-cheese waffles / pancakes  
* *Sooji* (semolina) pancakes  
* Korean-flavored tofu stir-fry

---

## Cheat Meals

I tried to avoid true cheat meals, but my sweet-tooth workaround was **cottage-cheese waffles**—high protein, low sat-fat, and you *can’t taste* the cottage cheese.

---

## Foods I Missed (Couldn’t Find Good Substitutes)

* Pizza (the cheese!)  
* Chocolate  
* Donuts  
* Butter-heavy cookies & pastries

Every “healthy” version I tried tasted like cardboard; I chose abstinence over disappointment.

---

## Exercise

* ≈ 10 000 steps/day (light walking burns a few hundred kcal)  
* Minimal weights or HIIT—lots of false starts here. I could improve this phase.

---

## Conclusion

These three months accomplished:

* **Fiber** ∼ 40 g/day  
* **Sat fat** kept low  
* **Protein** > 100 g/day

Body weight settled at **147 lb** and I feel noticeably better.

---

## What’s Next

* Maintain high fiber + protein  
* Loosen cheat days (slightly higher sat-fat)  
* Ramp up cardio & consistent weight training  

My hunch: fiber alone did most of the LDL-lowering heavy-lifting. Time will tell
whether LDL stays low once I re-introduce moderate sat-fat.

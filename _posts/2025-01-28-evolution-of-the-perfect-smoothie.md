The perfect smoothie should have a lot of fiber and a lot of protein. I've been on the hunt for the perfect smoothie for years. They're listed below. They're all great, but the latest version seems like one that I can stick to.


## Smoothie #1

Late 2023, my cholesterol got really high and so I worked to lower it. In [this article](/ldl-down-70-points/) I describe the smoothie I used to lower my cholesterol. For completeness, here it is again:

* 8 oz unsweetened soy milk  
* 30 g Gold Standard whey  
* 12 g chia seeds (soaked)  
* 8 g psyllium husk  
* 16 g peanut-butter powder  
* 5 g cinnamon  
* 5 g unsweetened cocoa

This was a good one, but for some reason whey protein doesn't sit well with my stomach. So I decided to switch it up.

## Smoothie #2

I'm slightly obsessed with Bryan Johnson and his quest to live forever. This smoothie is an ode to him. 

* 8 oz unsweetened soy milk
* 2 cups water
* 68 g Truvani unflavored pea protein  
* 126 g frozen mixed berries from Costco
* 60 g soaked chia seeds (12 grams dry)
* 10 g psyllium husk  
* 12 grams of chlorella
* 6 grams Blueprint Cocoa Powder
* 10 grams Blueprint collagen
* 1 gram turmeric
* 5 grams creatine

This is a great smoothie with a ton of protein and fiber. Unfortuantely, it tastes like shit. So I updated to the latest version I'm on. 

## Smoothie #3 (The latest!)

* 8 oz unsweetened soy milk
* 2 cups water
* 68 g Truvani unflavored pea protein  
* 126 g frozen mixed berries from Costco
* 60 g soaked chia seeds (12 grams dry)
* 10 g psyllium husk  

This tastes pretty good, satisfies a nice craving for something sweet and keps me full. 

In this version, I removed chlorella, cocoa, collagen, turmeric and creatiune from Smoothie version #2. 

But I still take this stuff every day. Now I throw it in a glass, mix it up and down it in the morning right when I wake up.

Enjoy! I hope you live forever!

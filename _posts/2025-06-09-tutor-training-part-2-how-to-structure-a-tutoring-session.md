I will assume this isn't your first session. Check out this post on how to structure your first tutoring session. 


Here are the steps to structure a tutoring session:

1. Plan bite-sized lessons ahead of time.
2. Do some retrieval practice from the previous session.
3. Use your lessons to do "I do, we do, you do"
4. Do some retrieval practice from the current session.
   
Let's go through these steps in detail.

## Plan bite-sized lessons ahead of time

It's important that the lessons you plan are bite-sized. This means that you should plan to cover one or two concepts in each lesson. This will make it easier for the student to understand and remember the material.

For example, let's say your student is learning about adding fractions. There are a lot of ways to practice. For example, you could create a single lesson that has problems like this: 

1. $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = ?$ 
   
2. $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = ?$ 
   
3. $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{5} = ?$
   
4. $\frac{7}{5} + \frac{1}{6} = ?$ 

What would be the issue if we just had one lesson with these problems? And could we break this lesson into two smaller lessons?

Yes! I think there could be many lessons created from this:
1. Adding fractions with the same denominator
2. Adding fractions with different denominators
3. Adding mixed numbers
4. Adding improper fractions
5. Adding fractions that need to be reduced

### Ok but how do you actually create a bite-sized lesson? 

You can structure a lesson in the following way:

1. A tutorial of sorts. This could be some written text or a video or just a conversation. The goal is to explain the single concept.
2. A few examples on that topic. 
3. 7-10 problems on that topic.

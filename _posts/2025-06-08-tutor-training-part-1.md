Before we dive into how to teach most effectively, we have to get rid of some myths. If you're a tutor at Learn To Be, you need to know these. 


## Myth 1: "Student's learn better when taught in their preferred learning style."

This is one that has become so deeply ingrained in our heads but we need to stop. If you're a tutor at Learn To Be, you have to know this one: there is no evidence that students have different learning styles. Students who say they're visual learners vs oral learners vs kinaesthetic learners do not learn better when taught in their preferred mode. 

What IS true is that some material is better in certain ways. For example, if you're teaching geometry, you should use diagrams. If you're teaching phonics, you should use sound. If you're teaching history, you might just use words. Or you might use diagrams. 

But regardless of the content, there is no evidence that students learn better when taught in their preferred mode. 

*What happens if a parent or student says they are a visual learner?* Listen to them, no need to tell them otehrwise. But use what's taught in this tutor training to teach according to the content.

## Myth 2: "Kids learn at the same pace"

Almost every kid has a huge ceiling on their potential. But some will have to work harder to get there. You might be tutoring two kids in their times tables. One kid seems to be memorizing them faster than the other. And that's ok. That will be the case. Some people learn faster than others.

As a tutor, it will be up to you to keep the student who is learning a little bit slower motivated. We'll talk more about how to do that in this tutor training.

## Myth 3: “Learning should feel easy”

It's actually the opposite! Learning should feel hard. When you're asked a question, how you know you've learned it is if you can tease it out of your brain. And in the early stages of learning something, that can be hard.

## Myth 4: “Highlight, reread, cram = good study habits”

If you want to get an A on a test that's coming up in a few days, then *maybe* highlighting, rereading, and cramming will work. But if you want to learn something for the long term, then this will never, ever work.

For long term learning, it's actually important to study something and then put it away and come back to it later (maybe a day or two later) and then test yourself on it. This is called "spaced repetition". 

You space out your learning. So, for example, let's say you learn a new random fact like "the capital of Canada is Ottawa." What you traditionally have been told to do is to make a flashcard or something and just drill this fact over and over again. 

But if you're smart about it, you'll read this fact for a couple of minutes and then put it away. And then come back to it a day or two later and test yourself on it. You'll see if you can pull it out of your brain. Maybe the first time you look at it again, you won't remember and you'll have to look at the answer. You study a little bit more. And then you put it away again. And then you come back to it a day or two later and test yourself on it again. And you keep doing this. Eventually, this will be committed to your long term memory.

That's what we mean by "spaced" in spaced repetition. You're spacing your studying out.

## Myth 5: “Fun = learning”

Engagement helps **attention**, but students can be engrossed in an activity while thinking about the wrong thing—speed-typing answers into Kahoot, for instance. Learning only sticks when their working memory grapples with the *meaningful* element of the task.

## Myth 6: “Discovery learning works for novices”

This will be less relevant to you as a tutor, but it's still important to know. Some people think that students learn better when they "discover" things on their own. But this is not true. Students learn better when they are taught directly. This is called "direct instruction". You teach the child directly what they need to know. One way in which you can do this is via the "I do, we do, you do" method.

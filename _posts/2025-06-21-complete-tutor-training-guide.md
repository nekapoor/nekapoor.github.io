Welcome to the complete Learn To Be tutor training guide. This comprehensive resource covers the six core evidence-based learning principles that every effective tutor should understand and apply. Each principle is backed by cognitive science research and includes specific guidance on how to implement it during your tutoring sessions.

## 1. Automaticity: Building Fluent Foundations

**What it is:** Automaticity is the ability to perform skills so fluently that they require minimal conscious attention, freeing up working memory for higher-order thinking.

**The Science:** When students haven't developed automaticity in foundational skills, their limited working memory gets consumed by basic operations, leaving no mental space for problem-solving or creativity.

**Learn more:** [Cognitive Science of Learning: Developing Automaticity](https://www.justinmath.com/cognitive-science-of-learning-developing-automaticity/)

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**Before moving to new concepts:**
- Assess which foundational skills need strengthening (math facts, sight words, etc.)
- Use quick fluency checks: "Let's do some rapid-fire multiplication tables before we tackle word problems"

**During practice:**
- Set both accuracy AND speed goals: "Let's aim to get these addition facts correct in under 3 seconds each"
- Use timed drills, but keep them short and engaging
- Celebrate when students achieve automatic recall

**Maintaining automaticity:**
- Start each session with 2-3 minutes of foundational skill practice
- Regularly revisit previously mastered skills to prevent decay
- Connect automatic skills to new learning: "Since you know your times tables automatically, you can focus on the problem-solving strategy here"

## 2. Retrieval Practice: Strengthening Memory Through Testing

**What it is:** Retrieval practice involves recalling information from memory rather than simply re-reading or reviewing notes. The act of retrieval itself strengthens memory.

**The Science:** Testing isn't just for assessment—it's one of the most powerful learning tools. Students remember information better when they practice pulling it out of their memory.

**Learn more:** [Retrieval Practice Guide](https://pdf.retrievalpractice.org/RetrievalPracticeGuide.pdf)

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**Start each session with retrieval:**
- "Before we learn something new, let's see what you remember from last time"
- Ask specific questions about previous concepts without giving hints first
- Use mini-quizzes or flashcards for key facts and procedures

**During learning:**
- After explaining a concept, close your notes and ask the student to explain it back
- Use the "blank page" technique: have students write down everything they remember about a topic
- Ask "How did you solve that?" to make students retrieve their thinking process

**End sessions with retrieval:**
- "Let's review what we covered today without looking at our notes"
- Give students 2-3 practice problems that require them to recall the day's learning
- Assign retrieval-based homework: "Tomorrow, try to solve these problems before reviewing your notes"

## 3. Spaced Retrieval Practice: Timing for Long-Term Retention

**What it is:** Spacing out retrieval practice over time (rather than massing it in one session) dramatically improves long-term retention.

**The Science:** Information reviewed at increasing intervals becomes more deeply embedded in long-term memory. The slight forgetting that occurs between sessions actually strengthens memory when information is successfully retrieved.

**Learn more:** [Spacing Guide](https://pdf.retrievalpractice.org/SpacingGuide.pdf)

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**Plan your review schedule:**
- Review new concepts the next session, then again after a week, then after two weeks
- Keep a simple tracking system of what needs to be reviewed when
- Don't abandon topics once "mastered"—schedule periodic check-ins

**Structure your sessions:**
- Spend the first 10 minutes reviewing concepts from 1-2 sessions ago
- Include a few problems from several sessions back
- Mix recent and older material throughout the session

**Communicate with students:**
- Explain why you're reviewing "old" material: "We're not going backwards—we're making sure this sticks in your long-term memory"
- Help students see the connection between spaced practice and their improved performance over time

## 4. Interleaving: Mixing Practice for Better Learning

**What it is:** Interleaving involves mixing different types of problems or concepts within a single practice session, rather than practicing one type at a time (blocking).

**The Science:** While blocking feels easier and shows faster initial improvement, interleaving leads to better long-term retention and improved ability to discriminate between different problem types.

**Learn more:** [Interleaving](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/interleaving)

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**Mix problem types:**
- Instead of doing 10 addition problems, then 10 subtraction problems, alternate: addition, subtraction, addition, multiplication, subtraction
- For reading: alternate between different comprehension strategies within one passage
- For writing: practice different sentence types within one paragraph

**Interleave concepts across sessions:**
- Don't finish one topic completely before starting another
- Return to previous topics while introducing new ones
- Create problem sets that require students to identify which strategy to use

**Help students with the difficulty:**
- Warn students that interleaved practice feels harder initially: "This might feel more challenging, but it's helping your brain learn better"
- Emphasize the discrimination skill: "Part of learning math is knowing which type of problem you're looking at"
- Celebrate when students correctly identify problem types: "Great! You recognized this was a proportion problem"

## 5. Reducing Cognitive Load: Managing Mental Resources

**What it is:** Cognitive load theory recognizes that our working memory is limited. Effective instruction minimizes unnecessary mental burden so students can focus on learning.

**The Science:** Students can only process a limited amount of information at once. When cognitive load is too high, learning suffers. We must carefully manage what we ask students to think about simultaneously.

**Learn more:** [Cognitive Science of Learning: Minimizing Cognitive Load](https://www.justinmath.com/cognitive-science-of-learning-minimizing-cognitive-load/)

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**Break concepts into small chunks:**
- Introduce one new idea at a time
- Master each component before combining them
- Use the "bite-sized lessons" approach: focus on single concepts per session

**Reduce extraneous load:**
- Minimize distractions in your tutoring environment
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid introducing multiple new terms simultaneously
- Keep examples focused on the core concept

**Support working memory:**
- Provide reference sheets for formulas or steps
- Use visual aids and diagrams
- Allow students to write down intermediate steps
- Don't rush—give time for processing

**Gradually increase complexity:**
- Start with the simplest version of a concept
- Add complexity only after the basics are solid
- Remove supports (like reference sheets) gradually as automaticity develops

## 6. "I Do, We Do, You Do": The Gradual Release Model

**What it is:** A structured approach to instruction where the tutor first models a skill (I Do), then works through examples with the student (We Do), and finally has the student practice independently (You Do).

**The Science:** This gradual release of responsibility allows students to build confidence and competence systematically. It provides scaffolding that's removed as students become more capable.

### How This Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions

**"I Do" - Modeling (5-10 minutes):**
- Demonstrate the complete process while thinking aloud
- Keep your example simple and focused on the core concept
- Explain your reasoning: "I'm doing this because..."
- Don't ask questions yet—just show the complete process
- Example: "I'm going to show you how to solve this fraction addition problem. First, I need to find a common denominator..."

**"We Do" - Guided Practice (10-15 minutes):**
- Work through 2-3 examples together
- Start by doing most of the work, gradually shifting responsibility to the student
- Ask guiding questions: "What should we do first?" "Why did we choose that denominator?"
- Provide immediate feedback and correction
- Let students make mistakes and guide them to self-correction
- Example: "Now let's try one together. You tell me what the first step should be..."

**"You Do" - Independent Practice (15-20 minutes):**
- Have students work through problems independently
- Resist the urge to jump in immediately when they struggle
- Provide hints rather than answers: "Look back at what we did in the first step"
- Observe their process, not just their answers
- Celebrate both correct processes and correct answers
- Example: "Now try these three problems on your own. I'll be here if you get stuck, but see how much you can do independently."

**Key principles for all three phases:**
- Keep cognitive load manageable—focus on one small concept at a time
- Move between phases based on student understanding, not a rigid timeline
- Some students may need more "We Do" time before moving to "You Do"
- Return to earlier phases if students struggle during independent practice

## Putting It All Together: A Complete Learn To Be Session

Here's how these six principles work together in a typical 45-60 minute tutoring session:

**Opening (5 minutes):**
- **Retrieval practice:** Quick review of concepts from previous sessions
- **Spaced practice:** Include problems from 1-2 weeks ago
- **Automaticity:** Brief drill of foundational skills

**Main instruction (25-35 minutes):**
- **Cognitive load:** Introduce one new concept using bite-sized chunks
- **I Do, We Do, You Do:** Systematic progression through the new material
- **Interleaving:** Mix the new concept with previously learned material

**Closing (5-10 minutes):**
- **Retrieval practice:** Have student explain what they learned without notes
- **Spaced practice:** Assign problems that will be reviewed in future sessions
- **Automaticity:** Quick practice of skills that need to become automatic

**Between sessions:**
- Plan which concepts need spaced review
- Prepare interleaved problem sets
- Identify foundational skills that need automaticity work

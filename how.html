    <h1>How We Got These Numbers</h1>

    <p>
      These figures are broad estimates meant to convey the scale of reading challenges among U.S. students. 
      They are based on publicly available data from sources such as the National Assessment of Educational 
      Progress (<a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/" target="_blank">NAEP</a>) and 
      the National Center for Education Statistics.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Total Number of K–12 Students</h2>
    <p>
      Approximately <strong>49 million</strong> students are enrolled in U.S. public K–12 schools. 
      This estimate comes from the 
      <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_203.10.asp" target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Percentage of Students Who Struggle with Reading</h2>
    <p>
      According to <strong>NAEP</strong>, around <strong>33%</strong> of 4th graders read 
      <em>below the Basic</em> level. 
      These are students who have not demonstrated even partial mastery of fundamental reading skills.
      For simplicity, we use <strong>30%</strong> across K–12 to represent students struggling significantly 
      with reading. 
    </p>

    <h2>3. Calculating the Number of Struggling Readers</h2>
    <p>
      We multiply 49 million total students by 30% to get about 
      <strong>14.7 million</strong> struggling readers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Annual Cost per Struggling Reader</h2>
    <p>
      Research on literacy interventions, future lost earnings, and related societal impacts 
      can place the per-student cost anywhere from \$2,000 to \$10,000. 
      For our estimate, we use <strong>\$2,500 per student</strong> per year. 
      This represents extra reading interventions, remedial education, and the broader 
      economic impact of widespread illiteracy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Total Annual Cost</h2>
    <p>
      Multiplying <strong>14.7 million</strong> struggling readers by <strong>\$2,500</strong> 
      each yields <strong>\$36.75 billion</strong> in total annual cost.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      These numbers are approximate, provided for awareness and advocacy. 
      Real-world figures vary by region, intervention type, and broader economic factors.

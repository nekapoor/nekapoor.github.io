<p>Before we dive into how to teach most effectively, we have to get rid
of some myths. If you’re a tutor at Learn To Be, you need to know
these.</p>
<h2
id="myth-1-students-learn-better-when-taught-in-their-preferred-learning-style.">Myth
1: “Student’s learn better when taught in their preferred learning
style.”</h2>
<p>This is one that has become so deeply ingrained in our heads but we
need to stop. If you’re a tutor at Learn To Be, you have to know this
one: there is no evidence that students have different learning styles.
Students who say they’re visual learners vs oral learners vs
kinaesthetic learners do not learn better when taught in their preferred
mode.</p>
<p>What IS true is that some material is better in certain ways. For
example, if you’re teaching geometry, you should use diagrams. If you’re
teaching phonics, you should use sound. If you’re teaching history, you
might just use words. Or you might use diagrams.</p>
<p>But regardless of the content, there is no evidence that students
learn better when taught in their preferred mode.</p>
<p><em>What happens if a parent or student says they are a visual
learner?</em> Listen to them, no need to tell them otehrwise. But use
what’s taught in this tutor training to teach according to the
content.</p>

<h2 id="myth-2-kids-learn-at-the-same-pace">Myth 2: “Kids learn at the
same pace”</h2>
<p>Almost every kid has a huge ceiling on their potential. But some will
have to work harder to get there. You might be tutoring two kids in
their times tables. One kid seems to be memorizing them faster than the
other. And that’s ok. That will be the case. Some people learn faster
than others.</p>
<p>As a tutor, it will be up to you to keep the student who is learning
a little bit slower motivated. We’ll talk more about how to do that in
this tutor training.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="myth-3-learning-should-feel-easy">Myth 3: “Learning should feel
easy”</h2>
<p>It’s actually the opposite! Learning should feel hard. When you’re
asked a question, how you know you’ve learned it is if you can tease it
out of your brain. And in the early stages of learning something, that
can be hard.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-4-highlight-reread-cram-good-study-habits">Myth 4:
“Highlight, reread, cram = good study habits”</h2>
<p>If you want to get an A on a test that’s coming up in a few days,
then <em>maybe</em> highlighting, rereading, and cramming will work. But
if you want to learn something for the long term, then this will never,
ever work.</p>
<p>For long term learning, it’s actually important to study something
and then put it away and come back to it later (maybe a day or two
later) and then test yourself on it. This is called “spaced
repetition”.</p>
<p>You space out your learning. So, for example, let’s say you learn a
new random fact like “the capital of Canada is Ottawa.” What you
traditionally have been told to do is to make a flashcard or something
and just drill this fact over and over again.</p>
<p>But if you’re smart about it, you’ll read this fact for a couple of
minutes and then put it away. And then come back to it a day or two
later and test yourself on it. You’ll see if you can pull it out of your
brain. Maybe the first time you look at it again, you won’t remember and
you’ll have to look at the answer. You study a little bit more. And then
you put it away again. And then you come back to it a day or two later
and test yourself on it again. And you keep doing this. Eventually, this
will be committed to your long term memory.</p>
<p>That’s what we mean by “spaced” in spaced repetition. You’re spacing
your studying out.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this idea of spaced repetition, check
out this <a

<hr />
<h2 id="myth-5-fun-learning">Myth 5: “Fun = learning”</h2>
<p>Engagement helps <strong>attention</strong>, but students can be
engrossed in an activity while thinking about the wrong
thing—speed-typing answers into Kahoot, for instance. Learning only
sticks when their working memory grapples with the <em>meaningful</em>
element of the task.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-6-discovery-learning-works-for-novices">Myth 6: “Discovery
learning works for novices”</h2>
<p>This will be less relevant to you as a tutor, but it’s still
important to know. Some people think that students learn better when
they “discover” things on their own. But this is not true. Students
learn better when they are taught directly. This is called “direct
instruction”. You teach the child directly what they need to know. One
way in which you can do this is via the “I do, we do, you do”
method.</p>

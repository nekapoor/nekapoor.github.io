<p>Welcome to the complete Learn To Be tutor training guide. This
comprehensive resource covers the six core evidence-based learning
principles that every effective tutor should understand and apply. Each
principle is backed by cognitive science research and includes specific
guidance on how to implement it during your tutoring sessions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="automaticity-building-fluent-foundations">1. Automaticity:
Building Fluent Foundations</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Automaticity is the ability to perform
skills so fluently that they require minimal conscious attention,
freeing up working memory for higher-order thinking.</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> When students haven’t developed
automaticity in foundational skills, their limited working memory gets
consumed by basic operations, leaving no mental space for
problem-solving or creativity.</p>

Science of Learning: Developing Automaticity</a></p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Before moving to new concepts:</strong> - Assess which
foundational skills need strengthening (math facts, sight words, etc.) -
Use quick fluency checks: “Let’s do some rapid-fire multiplication
tables before we tackle word problems”</p>
<p><strong>During practice:</strong> - Set both accuracy AND speed
goals: “Let’s aim to get these addition facts correct in under 3 seconds
each” - Use timed drills, but keep them short and engaging - Celebrate
when students achieve automatic recall</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining automaticity:</strong> - Start each session with
2-3 minutes of foundational skill practice - Regularly revisit
previously mastered skills to prevent decay - Connect automatic skills
to new learning: “Since you know your times tables automatically, you
can focus on the problem-solving strategy here”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="retrieval-practice-strengthening-memory-through-testing">2.
Retrieval Practice: Strengthening Memory Through Testing</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Retrieval practice involves recalling
information from memory rather than simply re-reading or reviewing
notes. The act of retrieval itself strengthens memory.</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> Testing isn’t just for assessment—it’s
one of the most powerful learning tools. Students remember information
better when they practice pulling it out of their memory.</p>

Practice Guide</a></p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions-1">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Start each session with retrieval:</strong> - “Before we
learn something new, let’s see what you remember from last time” - Ask
specific questions about previous concepts without giving hints first -
Use mini-quizzes or flashcards for key facts and procedures</p>
<p><strong>During learning:</strong> - After explaining a concept, close
your notes and ask the student to explain it back - Use the “blank page”
technique: have students write down everything they remember about a
topic - Ask “How did you solve that?” to make students retrieve their
thinking process</p>
<p><strong>End sessions with retrieval:</strong> - “Let’s review what we
covered today without looking at our notes” - Give students 2-3 practice
problems that require them to recall the day’s learning - Assign
retrieval-based homework: “Tomorrow, try to solve these problems before
reviewing your notes”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="spaced-retrieval-practice-timing-for-long-term-retention">3.
Spaced Retrieval Practice: Timing for Long-Term Retention</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Spacing out retrieval practice over time
(rather than massing it in one session) dramatically improves long-term
retention.</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> Information reviewed at increasing
intervals becomes more deeply embedded in long-term memory. The slight
forgetting that occurs between sessions actually strengthens memory when
information is successfully retrieved.</p>

href="https://pdf.retrievalpractice.org/SpacingGuide.pdf">Spacing
Guide</a></p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions-2">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Plan your review schedule:</strong> - Review new concepts the
next session, then again after a week, then after two weeks - Keep a
simple tracking system of what needs to be reviewed when - Don’t abandon
topics once “mastered”—schedule periodic check-ins</p>
<p><strong>Structure your sessions:</strong> - Spend the first 10
minutes reviewing concepts from 1-2 sessions ago - Include a few
problems from several sessions back - Mix recent and older material
throughout the session</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with students:</strong> - Explain why you’re
reviewing “old” material: “We’re not going backwards—we’re making sure
this sticks in your long-term memory” - Help students see the connection
between spaced practice and their improved performance over time</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="interleaving-mixing-practice-for-better-learning">4.
Interleaving: Mixing Practice for Better Learning</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Interleaving involves mixing different
types of problems or concepts within a single practice session, rather
than practicing one type at a time (blocking).</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> While blocking feels easier and shows
faster initial improvement, interleaving leads to better long-term
retention and improved ability to discriminate between different problem
types.</p>
<p><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a
href="https://www.retrievalpractice.org/interleaving">Interleaving</a></p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions-3">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Mix problem types:</strong> - Instead of doing 10 addition
problems, then 10 subtraction problems, alternate: addition,
subtraction, addition, multiplication, subtraction - For reading:
alternate between different comprehension strategies within one passage
- For writing: practice different sentence types within one
paragraph</p>
<p><strong>Interleave concepts across sessions:</strong> - Don’t finish
one topic completely before starting another - Return to previous topics
while introducing new ones - Create problem sets that require students
to identify which strategy to use</p>
<p><strong>Help students with the difficulty:</strong> - Warn students
that interleaved practice feels harder initially: “This might feel more
challenging, but it’s helping your brain learn better” - Emphasize the
discrimination skill: “Part of learning math is knowing which type of
problem you’re looking at” - Celebrate when students correctly identify
problem types: “Great! You recognized this was a proportion problem”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reducing-cognitive-load-managing-mental-resources">5. Reducing
Cognitive Load: Managing Mental Resources</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Cognitive load theory recognizes that
our working memory is limited. Effective instruction minimizes
unnecessary mental burden so students can focus on learning.</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> Students can only process a limited
amount of information at once. When cognitive load is too high, learning
suffers. We must carefully manage what we ask students to think about
simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a
href="https://www.justinmath.com/cognitive-science-of-learning-minimizing-cognitive-load/">Cognitive
Science of Learning: Minimizing Cognitive Load</a></p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions-4">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Break concepts into small chunks:</strong> - Introduce one
new idea at a time - Master each component before combining them - Use
the “bite-sized lessons” approach: focus on single concepts per
session</p>
<p><strong>Reduce extraneous load:</strong> - Minimize distractions in
your tutoring environment - Use clear, simple language - Avoid
introducing multiple new terms simultaneously - Keep examples focused on
the core concept</p>
<p><strong>Support working memory:</strong> - Provide reference sheets
for formulas or steps - Use visual aids and diagrams - Allow students to
write down intermediate steps - Don’t rush—give time for processing</p>
<p><strong>Gradually increase complexity:</strong> - Start with the
simplest version of a concept - Add complexity only after the basics are
solid - Remove supports (like reference sheets) gradually as
automaticity develops</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="i-do-we-do-you-do-the-gradual-release-model">6. “I Do, We Do,
You Do”: The Gradual Release Model</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A structured approach to instruction
where the tutor first models a skill (I Do), then works through examples
with the student (We Do), and finally has the student practice
independently (You Do).</p>
<p><strong>The Science:</strong> This gradual release of responsibility
allows students to build confidence and competence systematically. It
provides scaffolding that’s removed as students become more capable.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-applies-to-learn-to-be-tutoring-sessions-5">How This
Applies to Learn To Be Tutoring Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>“I Do” - Modeling (5-10 minutes):</strong> - Demonstrate the
complete process while thinking aloud - Keep your example simple and
focused on the core concept - Explain your reasoning: “I’m doing this
because…” - Don’t ask questions yet—just show the complete process -
Example: “I’m going to show you how to solve this fraction addition
problem. First, I need to find a common denominator…”</p>
<p><strong>“We Do” - Guided Practice (10-15 minutes):</strong> - Work
through 2-3 examples together - Start by doing most of the work,
gradually shifting responsibility to the student - Ask guiding
questions: “What should we do first?” “Why did we choose that
denominator?” - Provide immediate feedback and correction - Let students
make mistakes and guide them to self-correction - Example: “Now let’s
try one together. You tell me what the first step should be…”</p>
<p><strong>“You Do” - Independent Practice (15-20 minutes):</strong> -
Have students work through problems independently - Resist the urge to
jump in immediately when they struggle - Provide hints rather than
answers: “Look back at what we did in the first step” - Observe their
process, not just their answers - Celebrate both correct processes and
correct answers - Example: “Now try these three problems on your own.
I’ll be here if you get stuck, but see how much you can do
independently.”</p>
<p><strong>Key principles for all three phases:</strong> - Keep
cognitive load manageable—focus on one small concept at a time - Move
between phases based on student understanding, not a rigid timeline -
Some students may need more “We Do” time before moving to “You Do” -
Return to earlier phases if students struggle during independent
practice</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together-a-complete-learn-to-be-session">Putting
It All Together: A Complete Learn To Be Session</h2>
<p>Here’s how these six principles work together in a typical 45-60
minute tutoring session:</p>
<p><strong>Opening (5 minutes):</strong> - <strong>Retrieval
practice:</strong> Quick review of concepts from previous sessions -
<strong>Spaced practice:</strong> Include problems from 1-2 weeks ago -
<strong>Automaticity:</strong> Brief drill of foundational skills</p>
<p><strong>Main instruction (25-35 minutes):</strong> -
<strong>Cognitive load:</strong> Introduce one new concept using
bite-sized chunks - <strong>I Do, We Do, You Do:</strong> Systematic
progression through the new material - <strong>Interleaving:</strong>
Mix the new concept with previously learned material</p>
<p><strong>Closing (5-10 minutes):</strong> - <strong>Retrieval
practice:</strong> Have student explain what they learned without notes
- <strong>Spaced practice:</strong> Assign problems that will be
reviewed in future sessions - <strong>Automaticity:</strong> Quick
practice of skills that need to become automatic</p>
<p><strong>Between sessions:</strong> - Plan which concepts need spaced
review - Prepare interleaved problem sets - Identify foundational skills
that need automaticity work</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These six evidence-based principles form the foundation of effective
tutoring at Learn To Be. By understanding and applying automaticity,
retrieval practice, spaced practice, interleaving, cognitive load
management, and the gradual release model, you’ll help students not just
improve their grades, but develop deep, lasting understanding.</p>
<p>Remember: these principles work together. You don’t need to choose
between them—the most effective tutoring sessions incorporate all six
principles in a seamless, student-centered approach.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t just to help students with their immediate homework or
test preparation. It’s to teach them how to learn effectively, building
skills and confidence that will serve them throughout their academic
journey and beyond.</p>
